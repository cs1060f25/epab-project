# EPAB - Unified Cyber-Fraud Detection Platform

A unified AI-driven cybersecurity and fraud detection platform that correlates security telemetry and financial events to detect and respond to cyber-enabled fraud in real-time.

## Overview

Financial institutions face converging cyber and fraud risks, yet defenses remain siloed. This platform ingests both security telemetry (network, identity, endpoint, email, cloud) and financial events (payments, transfers, behavioral signals) to cross-correlate anomalies and coordinate automated response with human-in-the-loop controls and audit-grade explainability.
